# Hii There

I built this project with the help of React.js.
Why I chose it was because I started learning React.js and I wanted to learn more with practice.

I learnt how to use React.js and how to break your application into components. Finally escaped tutorial hell `yay`.
The CSS got a bit tricky at times but it was pretty straightforward given some time to ponder over.

## Future development:

There will be none on this project except a few tweaks to the UI. But I do look forward to learn more of React.js and to learn more about the hooks and props in depth.
